# dbt_twitter_organic v0.1.0

The original release! The main focus of the package is to transform the core social media object tables into analytics-ready models that can be easily unioned in to other social media platform packages to get a single view. This is especially easy using our [Social Media Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_social_media_reporting).
